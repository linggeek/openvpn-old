Watch tutorial on YouTube: [â–¶ Setup your own VPN server](https://youtu.be/avYcoMKaXRc).

This script will let you setup your own VPN server, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`sudo wget https://skiddow.github.io/OpenVPN/openvpn-install.sh && sudo bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
